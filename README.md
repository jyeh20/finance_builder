<h1>Finance Builder</h1>

This is a mini project to help me learn how to write batch scripts. </br>
The project itself is an ongoing project for me to track my finances in Excel sheets by month. The goal is when I get home from work, my machine will run a script to open the current months Finance spreadsheet. If it is a new month, it will create a new spreadsheet from a template spreadsheet.
